Chaco 3.2.0 (July 15, 2009)
===========================

Enhancements
------------

  * Bounded grids - Horizontal and Vertical grid line start and end points can now be set to a fixed value in data space, or to be the return value of an arbitrary callable.  The start and end tick can also be configured via the data_min and data_max traits.

  * Added dictionary interface to ArrayPlotData

  * Added a Traits UI view to the ScalesAxis

  * Added a new chaco.overlays subpackage and a new overlay, the DataBox.

  * Improved appearance of PlotToolbar

  * Changed add_default_axis() in the plot_factory module to take an axis class as a keyword argument.

  * Refactored contour plots into a common base class and implemented proper event handling when their colormaps or data ranges change.

  * Changed default colormap on img_plot() and contour_plot() method of Plot to be Spectral instead of Jet.

  * Added two more color palettes to the auto color palette, and created a default_colors module.

  * Added CandlePlot renderer

  * Changed Plot Labels to able to display inside the plot area, instead of only on the outside

  * Added optional title attribute to plot legends

  * Updated all containers to respect and use the new fixed_preferred_size trait on enable.Component

  * New Examples:
    * Interval trait editor as a Chaco example (from Stefan van der Walt)
    * embedding an interactive Chaco plot inside a VTK RenderWindow using the new Enable VTK backend
    * lasso tool on an image plot
    * bounded grid
    * candle plot

Fixes
-----

  * Fixed call signature of ShowAllTickGenerator.get_ticks()
  
  * Plot.title_font is now a delegate to the underlying PlotLabel object (from Chris Colbert)

  * Fixed mouse event handling bug in RangeSelection (from Stefan van der Walt)

  * ImagePlots now redraw when their input data changes.

  * Fixed cached image invalidation in colormapped image plots

  * Optimized ScatterPlot.map_index() when index_only is True and the index data is sorted

  * Changed ColormappedScatterPlot to no longer incorrectly apply the fill_alpha to the outline color

  * Improved date ticking heuristics in chaco.scales subpackage, specifically eliminating the bug where all times between, midnight and 1am would be formatted at too course of a time resolution.

  * Cleanup of various examples (titles, appearance)

  * The spectrum.py (audio spectrograph) example now properly closes the audio stream.


3.1.0 (March 20, 2009)
======================

Enhancements
------------
  
  * Domain limits - Mappers now can declare the "limits" of their valid domain. PanTool and ZoomTool respect these limits.  (pwang)
  
  * Adding "hide_grids" parameter to Plot.img_plot() and Plot.contour_plot() so users can override the default behavior of hiding grids.  (pwang)
  
  * Refactored examples to declare a Demo object so they can be be run with the demo.py example launcher.  (vibha)

  * Adding chaco.overlays package with some canned SVG overlays. (bhendrix)

  * DragZoom now can scale both X and Y axes independently corresponding to the mouse cursor motion along the X and Y axes (similar to the zoom behavior in Matplotlib).  (pwang)

  * New Examples: 
    * world map (bhendrix)
    * more financial plots (pwang)
    * scatter_toggle (pwang)
    * stacked_axis (pwang)


Fixes
-----

  * Fixing the chaco.scales TimeFormatter to use the built-in localtime() instead of the one in the safetime.py module due to Daylight Savings Time issues with timedelta. (r23231, pwang)

  * Improved behavior of ScatterPlot when it doesn't get the type of metadata it expects in its "selections" and "selection_masks" metadata keys (r23121, pwang)
  
  * Setting the .range2d attribute on GridMapper now properly sets the two DataRange1D instances of its sub-mappers.  (r23119, pwang)
  
  * ScatterPlot.map_index() now respects the index_only flag (r23060, pwang)
  
  * Fixed occasional traceback/bug in LinePlot that occurred when data was completely outside the visible range (r23059, pwang)
  
  * Implementing is_in() on legends to account for padding and alignment (caused by tools that move the legend) (r23052, bhendrix)
  
  * Legend behaves properly when there are no plots to display (r23012, judah)
  
  * Fixed LogScale in the chaco.scales package to correctly handle the case when the length of the interval is less than a decade (r22907, warren.weckesser)
  
  * Fixed traceback when calling copy_traits() on a DataView (r22894, vibha)
  
  * Scatter plots generated by Plot.plot() now properly use the "auto" coloring feature of Plot. (r22727, pwang)
  
  * Reduced the size of screenshots in the user manual. (r22720, rkern)
