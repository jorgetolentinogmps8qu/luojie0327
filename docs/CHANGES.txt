3.1.0 (March 20, 2009)
======================

Enhancements
------------
  
  * Domain limits - Mappers now can declare the "limits" of their valid domain.
    PanTool and ZoomTool respect these limits.  (pwang)
  
  * Adding "hide_grids" parameter to Plot.img_plot() and Plot.contour_plot()
    so users can override the default behavior of hiding grids.  (pwang)
  
  * Refactored examples to declare a Demo object so they can be be run with
    the demo.py example launcher.  (vibha)

  * Adding chaco.overlays package with some canned SVG overlays. (bhendrix)

  * DragZoom now can scale both X and Y axes independently corresponding to
    the mouse cursor motion along the X and Y axes (similar to the zoom
    behavior in Matplotlib).  (pwang)

  * New Examples: 
    * world map (bhendrix)
    * more financial plots (pwang)
    * scatter_toggle (pwang)
    * stacked_axis (pwang)


Fixes
-----

  * Fixing the chaco.scales TimeFormatter to use the built-in localtime()
    instead of the one in the safetime.py module due to Daylight Savings
    Time issues with timedelta. (r23231, pwang)

  * Improved behavior of ScatterPlot when it doesn't get the type of metadata
    it expects in its "selections" and "selection_masks" metadata keys (r23121, pwang)
  
  * Setting the .range2d attribute on GridMapper now properly sets the two 
    DataRange1D instances of its sub-mappers.  (r23119, pwang)
  
  * ScatterPlot.map_index() now respects the index_only flag (r23060, pwang)
  
  * Fixed occasional traceback/bug in LinePlot that occurred when data was
    completely outside the visible range (r23059, pwang)
  
  * Implementing is_in() on legends to account for padding and alignment (caused
    by tools that move the legend) (r23052, bhendrix)
  
  * Legend behaves properly when there are no plots to display (r23012, judah)
  
  * Fixed LogScale in the chaco.scales package to correctly handle the case
    when the length of the interval is less than a decade (r22907, warren.weckesser)
  
  * Fixed traceback when calling copy_traits() on a DataView (r22894, vibha)
  
  * Scatter plots generated by Plot.plot() now properly use the "auto" 
    coloring feature of Plot. (r22727, pwang)
  
  * Reduced the size of screenshots in the user manual. (r22720, rkern)
