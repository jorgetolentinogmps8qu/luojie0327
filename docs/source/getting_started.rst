.. note::
   This section is currently actively being developed in preparation
   for the Scipy 2008 tutorial session.

Currently, the examples and the scipy 2006 tutorial are the best ways  
to get going quickly. (See http://code.enthought.com/projects/files/chaco_scipy06/chaco_talk.html)

Some tutorial examples were recently added into the examples/tutorials/scipy2008/  
directory on the trunk.  These examples are numbered and introduce  
concepts one at a time, going from a simple line plot to building a  
custom overlay with its own trait editor and reusing an existing tool  
from the built-in set of tools.  You can browse them on our SVN server  
at:
https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/browser/Chaco/trunk/examples/tutorials/scipy2008

There are API docs for the 2.7.1 version of Chaco (not the trunk  
version) at:
http://code.enthought.com/projects/files/ets_api/enthought.chaco2.html

There will be API documentation for ETS 3.0 once that gets released  
(as of 8/8/2008, ETS 3.0 is at beta2, which will be the last beta
release).
