Chaco Documentation
===================

Chaco is a Python package for building interactive and custom 2-D plots and
visualizations. It is part of the `Enthought Tool Suite <http://code.enthought.com/>`_. 

Chaco is a Python plotting application toolkit that facilitates writing
plotting applications at all levels of complexity, from simple scripts with
hard-coded data to large plotting programs with complex data interrelationships
and a multitude of interactive tools. While Chaco generates attractive static
plots for publication and presentation, it also works well for interactive
data visualization and exploration.

Chaco includes renderers for many popular plot types, built-in implementations of
common interactions with those plots, and a framework for extending and
customizing plots and interactions.  Chaco can also render graphics in a
non-interactive fashion to images, in either raster or vector formats, and it
has a subpackage for doing command-line plotting or simple scripting.
