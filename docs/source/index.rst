Chaco Documentation
===================

Chaco is a Python package for building interactive and custom 2-D plots and
visualizations. It has been optimized for displaying efficiently large 
datasets. 

It includes renderers for many popular plot types, built-in implementations of
common interactions with those plots, and a framework for extending and
customizing plots and interactions.  Chaco can also render graphics in a
non-interactive fashion to images, in either raster or vector formats, and it
has a subpackage for doing command-line plotting or simple scripting.

Chaco is built on three other Enthought packages:

  * `Traits <http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits>`_, as an event notification framework,
  * `Kiva <https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/wiki/Kiva>`_, for rendering 2-D graphics to a variety of backends across platforms,
  * `Enable <http://code.enthought.com/projects/enable/>`_, as a framework for writing interactive visual components, and for abstracting away GUI-toolkit-specific details of mouse and keyboard handling.

To deal efficiently with large datasets, it also relies on `Numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_.
Finally, Chaco currently requires either wxPython or PyQt to display interactive plots, but a cross-platform OpenGL backend (using Pyglet) is in the works, and it will not require WX or Qt.
