   for the Scipy 2008 tutorial session.

Installation
============

There are several different ways to get Chaco:

  #. Install the Enthought Python Distribution.
     Chaco and the rest of the Enthought Tool Suite are bundled with it.
  
  #. Install from PyPI using easy_install::
     
        easy_install Chaco

  #. (Linux) Install via the distribution's packaging mechanism.
     We provide .debs for Debian and Ubuntu and RPMs for Redhat.

  #. Download source as tarballs or from Subversion and build.  See 
     the :ref:`installation` section.



Tutorials
=========

Currently, the examples and the scipy 2006 tutorial are the best ways  
to get going quickly. (See http://code.enthought.com/projects/files/chaco_scipy06/chaco_talk.html)

Some tutorial examples were recently added into the examples/tutorials/scipy2008/  
directory on the trunk.  These examples are numbered and introduce  
concepts one at a time, going from a simple line plot to building a  
custom overlay with its own trait editor and reusing an existing tool  
from the built-in set of tools.  You can browse them on our SVN server  
at:
https://svn.enthought.com/enthought/browser/Chaco/trunk/examples/tutorials/scipy2008

API Docs
========

There are API docs for the 2.7.1 version of Chaco (not the trunk  
version) at:
http://code.enthought.com/projects/files/ets_api/enthought.chaco2.html

There will be API documentation for ETS 3.0 once that gets released  
(as of 8/8/2008, ETS 3.0 is at beta2, which will be the last beta
release).
