Interactive Plotting with Chaco
###############################

Overview
========

This tutorial is an introduction to Chaco. We're going to build several
mini-applications of increasing capability and complexity. Chaco was designed to
be used primarily by scientific programmers, and this tutorial only requires
basic familiarity with Python.

Knowledge of Numpy can be helpful for certain parts of the tutorial. Knowledge
of GUI programming concepts such as widgets, windows, and events are helpful
for the last portion of the tutorial, but it is not required.

This tutorial will demonstrate using Chaco with Traits UI, so knowledge of the
Traits framework is also helpful. We don't use very many sophisticated aspects
of Traits or Traits UI, and it is entirely possible to pick it up as you go
through the tutorial.

It's also worth pointing out that you don't *have* to use Traits UI in order to
use Chaco --- you can integrate Chaco directly with Qt or wxPython --- but for
this tutorial, we use Traits UI to make things easier.

Goals
=====

By the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to:

    - create Chaco plots of various types
    - arrange plots of data items in various layouts
    - configure and interact with your plots using Traits UI
    - create a custom plot overlay
    - create a custom tool that interacts with the mouse


Introduction
============

Chaco is a *plotting application toolkit*. This means that it can build
both static plots and dynamic data visualizations that let you
interactively explore your data. Here are four basic examples of Chaco plots:

.. image:: images/tornado.png

This plot shows a static "tornado plot" with a categorical Y axis and continuous
X axis.  The plot is resizable, but the user cannot interact or explore the data
in any way.

.. image:: images/simple_line.png

This is an overlaid composition of line and scatter plots with a legend. Unlike
the previous plot, the user can pan and zoom this plot, exploring the
relationship between data curves in areas that appear densely overlapping.
Furthermore, the user can move the legend to an arbitrary position on the plot,
and as they resize the plot, the legend maintains the same screen-space
separation relative to its closest corner.

.. image:: images/regression.png

This example starts to demonstrate interacting with the dataset in an
exploratory way. Whereas interactivity in the previous example was limited to
basic pan and zoom (which are fairly common in most plotting libraries), this is
an example of a more advanced interaction that allows a level of data
exploration beyond the standard view manipuations.

With this example, the user can select a region of data space, and a simple
line fit is applied to the selected points. The equation of the line is
then displayed in a text label.

The lasso selection tool and regression overlay are both built in to Chaco,
but they serve an additional purpose of demonstrating how one can build complex
data-centric interactions and displays on top of the Chaco framework.

Script-oriented Plotting
========================

We distinguish between "static" plots and "interactive visualizations"
because these different applications of a library affect the structure
of how the library is written, as well as the code you write to use the
library.

Here is a simple example of the "script-oriented" approach for creating
a static plot.  This is probably familiar to anyone who has used Gnuplot,
MATLAB, or Matplotlib::

    from numpy import *
    from enthought.chaco.shell import *

    x = linspace(-2*pi, 2*pi, 100)
    y = sin(x)

    plot(x, y, "r-")
    title("First plot")
    ytitle("sin(x)")
    show()

.. image:: images/script_oriented.png

The basic structure of this example is that we generate some data, then we call
functions to plot the data and configure the plot. There is a global concept of
"the active plot", and the functions do high-level manipulations on it. The
generated plot is then usually saved to disk for inclusion in a journal article
or presentation slides.

Now, as it so happens, this particular example uses the `chaco.shell`
script plotting package, so when you run this script, the plot that Chaco opens
does have some basic interactivity. You can pan and zoom, and even move forwards
and backwards through your zoom history. But ultimately it's a pretty static
view into the data.


Application-oriented Plotting
=============================

The second approach to plotting can be thought of as "application-oriented", for
lack of a better term. There is definitely a bit more code, and the plot
initially doesn't look much different, but it sets us up to do more interesting
things, as you'll see later on::

    class LinePlot(HasTraits):
        plot = Instance(Plot)
        traits_view = View(
            Item('plot',editor=ComponentEditor(),
                 show_label=False), 
            width=500, height=500,
            resizable=True,
            title="Chaco Plot")

        def __init__(self):
            x = linspace(-14, 14, 100)
            y = sin(x) * x**3
            plotdata = ArrayPlotData(x = x, y = y)
            plot = Plot(plotdata)
            plot.plot(("x", "y"), type="line",
                      color="blue")
            plot.title = "sin(x) * x^3"
            self.plot = plot

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        LinePlot().configure_traits()

This produces a plot similar to the previous script-oriented code snippet:

.. image:: images/first_plot.png

So, this is our first "real" Chaco plot. We'll walk through this code and
look at what each bit does.  This example serves as the basis for many of the
later examples.

Understanding the First Plot
============================

Let's start with the basics.  First, we declare a class to represent our
class, called "LinePlot"::

    class LinePlot(HasTraits):
        plot = Instance(Plot)

This class uses the Enthought Traits package, so we subclass from 
:class:`HasTraits`.
